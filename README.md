# PicMadLibs

Final Project Udacity IOS Nanodegree

PicMadLibs is a iOS app which allows a user to input a Noun, Verb, Adverb, & Adjective and it will generate a picture obtained via Flickr for each word. 

When Creating a new PicMadLib you must fill in all the fields with a word for each type. If you can't think of any words and need help there is a guide for each word type to give you an idea or example of that type of word. You also have the option to use the Randomizer button when filling out the form to fill in the Noun, Verb, Adverb, and Adjective fields. Also if you accidently leave one of the fields blank and click on the GENERATE button it will automatically populate the field with a random word based on the type of word missing. 

Each PicsMadLib will be stored and shows a time stamp on when it was created and a preview of the images that it is using for the PicMadLib. You can click on each PicMadLib to see a more Detailed view. You can click on the Share button on the bottom Right to save the image or share it with your friends. Or if you want to Edit the PicMadLib and change a word just click on the Edit button to update the PicMadLib etc.

To delete a PicMadLib on the Home Screen you can either swipe the PicMadLib Preview and click on the Delete button that appears or like on the Edit button and press on which PicMadLib to delete and then click on the Delete button.
